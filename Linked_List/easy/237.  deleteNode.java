/**
237. Delete Node in a Linked List
DescriptionHintsSubmissionsDiscussSolution
Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

    4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9
Example 1:

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list
             should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
Example 2:

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list
             should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
Note:

The linked list will have at least two elements.
All of the nodes' values will be unique.
The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
Do not return anything from your function.

/** Please pay attention that the input is not head pointer, it is just a node which should be removed. 
    In general, we will change the next pointer of node which is previous node of the target node to the node which is after
    the target node. But now, there is no such pointer to determine those node. Therefore, we can just use the target node.
    we can change the target node as the node next the target node then connect it with the seconde next node of the target node
